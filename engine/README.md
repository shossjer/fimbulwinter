# engine

Here we write all the different components that make up the engine, including (but not limited to) graphics, physics and sound.

The engine should be written entirely(?) using the principles of data-oriented-design since performance here is very important.

## Why is this its own project?

So that gameplay features do not defile the beauty that is the engine.
It is highly advantageous for when the time comes to make our next game.
Then most of the things in the engine will be reused (that is the whole point of this game project).
